## DeepLearning Projects: GANs

### Assignment Experience
This assignment allows me to employ Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and Cycle GAN (CycleGAN)
- to reconstruct images
- to implement unsupervised learning
- to identify patterns
- to build discriminator and generator networks
- to apply image mapping and translation

As mentioned in autoencoders README https://github.com/mminamina/Hands-on_DeepLearning---Autoencoders, this repository is inspired from Udacity DeepLearning Nanodegree https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch. 

Though I am not enrolled in the program, this assignment helps me apply GANs on various machine learning and Fin-tech challenges (to detect anomaly + to generate realistic fake data).

### Files
1. CycleGAN.ipynb
2. DCGAN.ipynb

### Cycle GAN
- Build Discriminator networks (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- Build Generator networks (Encoder+Decoder)
- Define ResidualBlock for generator
- Implement Least Squares GANs (LSGAN) loss function to avoid vanishing gradients problem
- Utilize unsupervised learning to learn from unpaired data
- Translate images from one domain to another
- Apply image mapping

### Deep Convolutional GAN 
- Construct deeper network to detect more complex patterns
- Build Discriminator & Generator (CNN + transpose CNN)
- Test out different hyperparameters
- Test if generator can make discriminator believe that reconstructed(fake) images are real


#### Packages Used
Python 3.6, Pytorch
